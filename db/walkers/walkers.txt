The accompanying dataset contains information collected by individual surveyors as part of stage-one (tractwalking) survey across the full extent of the Greek island of Antikythera (by the Antikythera Survey Project in 2005-7; www.ucl.ac.uk/asp). The data is in comma-delimited format (.csv) and an accompanying .csvt file offers simple field type designators for use with GDAL/OGR (see http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_csv.html).
