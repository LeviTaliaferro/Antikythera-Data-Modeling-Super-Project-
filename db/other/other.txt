The accompanying dataset contains information about all other finds (exclding pottery and lithics) collected across the full extent of the Greek island of Antikythera by the Antikythera Survey Project in 2005-7 (www.ucl.ac.uk/asp). The data is in comma-delimited format (.csv) and an accompanying .csvt file offers simple field type designators for use with GDAL/OGR (see http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_csv.html). It is provided under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For further information on individual data fields, please refer to the attribute field dictionary below:

"UID" - a unique identifier for the object, composed from either unit-walker-pass-section-object number(for those objects collected during stage-one tractwalking) or square-section-object number (for those objects collected during stage-two gridded collections)

"Xsugg" -  a suggested easting in the UTM WGS84 Zone 34N coordinate system. This has been randomised within the walker section or grid square involved and should be thought of has having a relative accuracy of ca.10m.

"Ysugg" - a suggested northing in the UTM WGS84 Zone 34N coordinate system. This has been randomised within the walker section or grid square involved and should be thought of has having a relative accuracy of ca.10m.

"Type" - refers to whether the object was recovered as part of stage-one tractwalking ('tract'), stage-two gridded collection ('grid') or as an opportunistic grab ('grab') at some other stage of the survey.

"Unit" - refers to either the tract number or the square id for the collection unit

"Walker" - the ASP team member id of the person who collected the object

"PassGrid" - the pass number (of the tract) or the grid number (of the set of collection squares) during which the object was collected

"Section" - the section of the survey unit during which the object was collected, either the 10m segment (5,15,25,35, etc.) of the walker line during tractwalking, the vacuum circle ('V') stage of gridded collection or the square grab stage ('S') of gridded collection.

"ObjNo" - the number of the object (unique within each section but not overall)

(Note that the chronoogical fields above, MNLN ... Other, always sum to 100 for each pottery record)
